Progress so far:
I have narrowed down on the workflow of my app and prepared the wire frames for the same. Following those I have created the most basic form of my consumer app.

Next to-do:
In the next few hours, I will be
1. Creating the client side app
2. Integrating these services to the robust backend
3. Integrating Amazon or third party APIs in my app for a credit system
